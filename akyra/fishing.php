					Duncanby Lodge is equipped with two different styles of unguided boats. First is the 16 foot
					Boston Whaler Dauntless. These boats are an open center console design that allows the angler
					easy access to all areas of the boat and is powered by a 60/70hp Yamaha 4 stroke outboard.
					<br></br>
					We also offer a 17 foot Hurston Glass Craft for unguided packages. These boats offer a very
					comfortable ride and have a retractable convertible top for sunny and rainy days. The boats are
					much lighter than the Whalers and are equipped with a 50hp Yamaha 4 stroke outboard.
					<br><br>
					At the end of each fishing day, dock staff will be there to assist you in parking and off loading your
					catch. Your boat will be meticulously detailed, pressure washed and restocked for the next day.
					Should you require any additional gear or instruction, our dock staff will be happy to assist you to
					ensure you feel comfortable and prepared. All boats are outfitted with: safety equipment, Garmin
					GPS, depth sounder, VHF radio, Scotty downriggers, rods, tackle box (mooching equipment),

					Our dock staff are trained extensively on the proper handling of your catch. Your fish are cleaned
					on a stainless steel table with continuous running, pumped sea water
					<br><br>
					Then, depending on your preference, the fish are filleted or left whole. Once the fish are
					processed and tagged with your name, they are sent to the vacuum packer for commercial grade vacuum
					sealing. The fish are then immediately put into our freezer.
					<br><br>
					On the day of your departure, your catch is then boxed, weighed and sent home with you. The
					process we have put in place ensures that your fish are well preserved and you will enjoy eating
					them as much as you did catching them!<br><br>
					Fishing Limits:<br>
					SALMON:   4 per day and possession total of 8 of which no more than 2/day or 4/trip

						What is the point of catch and release angling? Catch and release angling provides a memorable
						experience like no other for the angler, but more importantly it ensures the survival of the species.
						Carefully released Chinook salmon live and go on to spawn, increasing prospects of larger returns
						for future generations. At Duncanby Lodge we recognize the efforts of all our anglers who
						successfully land and release a Tyee Chinook Salmon with a brand new Islander MR3 fishing
						reel. After all, catch and release takes away none of the fight in your fish. So join in, because the
						only thing better than catching a world­class fish is ensuring he/she passes on those trophy
						genes.

							Mooching is the traditional way to fish in Rivers inlet. The method is quite simple: Use the mitre
							box provided to cut the perfect angle on your herring and affix the tandem hook set up (we will
							instruct you on this) to achieve a slow tight roll. The slower you can make it roll the more enticing
							it will be to a large Chinook. We use free weights ranging from 2­8 oz., however cutplug bait can
							also be trolled off a downrigger to achieve greater depths. We also provide you with 10’6’’ medium
							light weight mooching rods and Diawa M1 or Shimano GT2000 mooching reels that hold well over
							300 yards of 25­30lb test monofilament..
							and yes...we still get spooled!

						<p class="about-text">
							Trolling is a great way to target all salmon species. The main advantage is the increased speed in
							which you troll. In short, you can cover more ground to find fish. We use all varieties of gear:
							spoons, plugs, apex, hoochies, flashers and even teaser heads for anchovies and herring.
							This gear is primarily trolled off our Scotty
							downriggers at depths from 20­120ft. We use the same 10’6’’ mooching rod and reel combos for
							trolling. We do not stock tackle boxes with every colour of every lure. We do have a tackle shop
							with a limited supply of gear to lend out upon request. If you are a die­hard gear fisherman we
							encourage you to bring some of your favourite lures from home.

							We stock Gibbs Minnow Jigs for rockfish, Gibbs Floor Walker Jigs for lingcod, and a variety of
							large halibut jigs such as the Muddraker. For rockfish and lingcod we use spin casts and

						If trout or bass fishing is your hobby, don’t forget to bring your favourite rod and reel combo. We
						would suggest having your reel re­spooled with a minimum of 10 lb. test. We stock our trout
						combos with 12­20 lb, no­stretch spider, and tough­line. New line technology allows these lines to
						have the diameter of 4 lb­10lb monofilament, making it manageable to load 300 ft. of line on your
						lightweight combo. We use spin casts for a variety of species.
						<br><br>
						Rockfish/Cod: These fish can be caught on just about anything: Spoons, spinners, jigs, and bait
						just to name a few. Rockfish average 3­7lbs and lingcod can range between 5­30 lbs.
						Coho: Used in late August and early September to target Coho’s in river estuaries and intertidal
						pools. Number 4 and 5 Blue Fox Spinners in silver, blue and chartreuse, are our most productive
						lures. Weighted spoons such as the Gibbs Croc and Kitimat Killer have also been successful in
						blue, chartreuse, purple and silver.

						It’s every fly fisherman’s dream to cast into a body of water and have a variety of species compete
						for the fly.<br><br>
						At Duncanby, we’ve made this possible by locating the best spots, for the given time of year, to
						capitalize on various species.<br><br>
						Rockfish: Rockfish are caught all year round on the largest, ugliest fly you have in your box.
						Epoxy eyes are a must on your big trimmed streamers and buck tales. Try to find a colour they
						won’t bite. 325­grain sinking line is ideal for these species, however they will hit surface flies and
						can be found anywhere in the water column. Rockfish are typically found close to kelp beds and
						various rocky shorelines or substrates. A 6wt rod is good, although lingcod, which can be in
						excess of 20lbs, will often take your fly. Here, a 8wt is ideal.<br><br>
						Salmon: Fly fishing for salmon is done in mid to late August and takes place in various intertidal
						zones and estuaries. Pink salmon are typically the easiest to catch as they can be very
						aggressive while staging in estuaries. We find a 6wt rod to be the weapon of choice for this
						species. Pinks will bite any fly that is small, sparse and pink. Flies should be around 1⁄2 to 3⁄4 inch
						long. Our favourite fly is the Pink Comet and the small pink Woolly Bugger. Coho can also be
						caught on fly rods in the estuaries as well. Larger Clousers in pink, green and chartreuse are the
						main flies of choice. Minnow patterns such as sticklebacks, Mickey Finns and Rolled Muddlers are
						also good to try. You can get away with a 6wt rod, however your 8wt will give you a better chance
						if you hook one of our Coho that exceed the 20lb range. We also have success Buck Tailing for
						Coho in mid to late August. A large red, green, blue or chartreuse Buck Tail with a trailer hook is
						the most effective fly. Many anglers have success placing 2 small beads and a small spinning
						blade in front of the Buck Tail. Mother of pearl, artificial abalone and straight silver are the
						recommended blade colours. Lastly, we hook many large Chinook and Coho trolling with fly rods
						in the downrigger. In order to do this you must have a very large arbour fly reel with a wide spool.
						You will require 150 yards of backing before connecting an additional 150 yards of monofilament.
						You can then use your fly rod as you would a moocher, trolling a herring, anchovy or spoon.
						Fishing with this style of equipment will greatly increase your fight and test the most avid angler’s
						skill and endurance.

					A wise fisherman once said: “you can never have too many weapons in your arsenal...” <br><br>
					In the vast waters of Rivers Inlet, this statement holds true. Although cut bait is without a doubt
					the most successful method for enticing large fish, there are many days where the mere change
					of lure can trigger a bite. When fish are not feeding, sometimes it is a certain lure action or colour
					that will irritate them into striking. There is a seemingly endless list of factors that can contribute to
					the success of any given lure: Temperature, weather, depth, water visibility, current, tides, target
					species, and light conditions are just the tip of this complex iceberg.<br><br>
					Salt Water Tackle<br>
					The protected waters of Rivers Inlet, as well as the surrounding ocean, produce the largest fish on
					the coast each and every season. Although mostly fished with bait, these seas are a Mecca for
					the avid gear and fly fishermen.

					At Duncanby Sport Fishing lodge, on the central coast of British Columbia, we are fortunate to
					have the world’s most assorted aquatic ecosystem at our dock’s edge. Our season begins in medium
					to late June and runs until the first week of September. Our season is short, and for good reason.
					At Duncanby we don’t believe in “shoulder season”. If fish are not running, we are not open. It is
					that simple! We do however have different species that run in larger numbers throughout our
					season.<br><br>
					Late June and early July marks the peak of our run of Chinook salmon. Not only does Rivers Inlet
					get a run of our famous super tyee class Chinook at this time, but we also see our highest
					numbers of migratory Chinook that could be going as far south as California to spawn. As the
					season goes on the average size of our Chinook grow, until the first few weeks of August where
					we see our peak run of Chinook salmon in the 40­80lb range.

					Silvers are considered our action fish. We are fortunate enough to have our inlet filled with “blue
					back” Coho (5­8lbers) from mid June to early August. By Mid July our Northern Coho begin to
					appear and continue increasing in size and numbers until they seem to monopolize the ocean by
					the last week of August into early September. We also see terrific returns of Pink and Chum
					salmon. These salmon species appear in mid to late July and increase in numbers as we move
					through August.<br><br>
					Halibut are a fish that are readily available for or guests to catch all season. There is rarely a day
					when these fish can’t be found. Whether it’s early June or early September, halibut in excess of
					100lbs are caught in Rivers Inlet. We have a similarly consistent fishery for Ling Cod, red snapper
					(yellow eye rockfish) and rock cod. These fish are present throughout our season.
					Refer to the chart for better understanding of how our fish runs overlap.<br><br>
