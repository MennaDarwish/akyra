			 					Located in Rivers Inlet, (GPS 51'24'16.63"N,127'.38'43.69"W), on British Columbia's breathtakinig central Coast, our guests come from all over Canada, the
			 				  United States, and even Europe to xperience the Duncanby difference.<br>
			 					<br>
								Located in Rivers Inlet, Duncanby Lodge's is the premier destination for the West Coast Angler looking for trophy chinook salmon. With guide fleet of 12
								Grady White boats ranging from 22-28 feet and non-guided fleet of Boston Whalers, Duncanby is sure to impress both the enthusiiast and die hard
								fisherman alike.<br>
								<br>
								In addition to lodge operations, the Duncanby Team also value the time to marvel at a spectacular landscape which includes 28 miles(40km) miles of
								ocean and mountains leading to the headwaters of the Wannock and Kibella Rivers.<br>
								<br>
								Rivers Inlet includes multiple inlets islands, and bays boiling with sea life, while others hold a magnificent stillness and silence. Duncanby Lodge is happy
								to tour these surroundings whenever anglers limit out or want to take a fishing break.<br>
								<br>
								Some of these tours include a motor to the head of Drainy  Inlet, a place some guides call Jurassic park, or exploring serene Moses inlet to the mouth of
								the untouched Clyak River. A new hatcherty is being built at the head of the wukinau Village and will open in Spring 2016 and will supplemet the work
								done at the Snottli Hatchery at Bella Coola. There are pods of humpback whales, plus the falls in Waterfall Inlet. Fishing attracts anglers to Rivers Inlet,
								but it is the surroundings that bring them back. Rivers Inlet is home to diverse recreational fishery. Fishing grounds vary from large bull kelp beds to
								deep water open ocean to river estuaries holding mulyiple fish species. These conditions provide anglers the option to use a variety of fishing techniques:
								mooching, trolling, jigging, spin casting, and fly fishing. Duncanby Lodge has kayaks and canoes available for bear viewing or bird watching dominated by
								bald eagles and lions<br>
								<br>
								A stay at the Lodge includes all the necessary gear required. Anglers can choose to fish unguided or use the expertise of a guide. Duncanby Lodge's team
								of seven professional guides are ready to ensure anglers maximize time to experience the Duncanby difference.
