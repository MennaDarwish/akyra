			 			<p>Hatchery programs are absolutely vital for all species
			 				of salmon. Today 1 in 4 Chinook salmon is a hatchery
			 				fish. Think about that 1 in 4 Chinooks that is caught -
			 				be it sport, commercial, first nations or that returns to
			 				spawn - is a hatchery fish. Without these programs,
			 				the species would not survive.
			 				<br><br>
			 				Duncanby is very proud of our efforts to support
			 				hatchery programs. Rivers inlet last had its own
			 				hatchery over 20 years ago. We along with some other
			 				great partners, such as Rick Hansen Foundation,
			 				Pacific Salmon Foundation, The Northern Fund, LGL,
			 				Good Hope Cannery, DFO, Oweekeno Nation, and a
			 				growing list of friends, have been funding our research
			 				and the current egg takes.
			 				<br><br>
			 				We have been flying the eggs and sperm to the Snootli
			 				hatchery in Bella Coola and flying the babies back in
			 				the spring Snootli and the team there is made up of
			 				incredible people.But we simply can't handle all of the
			 				River systems that need help. The costs logistics and
			 				ability to do more are greatly restricted by weather and
			 				having to rely on planes.

			 			Five years ago, a group of us led by Rick Hansen and
			 			Ted Walkus met to discuss ways to help the famous
			 			Wannock River and the Wannock Chinook. 
			 			<br><br>
			 			
			 			These Wannock Chinook are very special fish. There
			 			are only 2 River Systems in the world that are consid-
			 			ered statistically significant for the production of
			 			salmon over 40 lbs. What that means is that if you
			 			catch a salmon over 40Ibs anywhere on the coast
			 			from Alaska to California there is a 90% chance it's
			 			from the Wannock or the Kitsumkalum river. 
			 			<br><br>
			 			
			 			The dream was born that day to one day have our own
			 			hatchery in Rivers Inlet again. It gives us great pride to
			 			say that the dream is now a reality and construction of
			 			our hatchery will start this spring 2016.
			 			 <br><br>
			 			
			 			Our program has already expanded to supporting
			 			other river systems with hatchery fish.The Chuckwalla
			 			Killbella rivers, which are in desperate decline, were
			 			added 2 years ago to our egg take program. We will be
			 			adding a Chum program next year and of great
			 			personal satisfaction to me the return of our

			 				Johnston Creek Coho program that we lost 4 years
			 				ago due to lack of available hatchery space.
			 				<br><br>
			 				Our Hatchery is going to be built in the Oweekeno
			 				Nations village. It's going to not only protect our fish
			 				for generations to come but create some very valuable
			 				employment and education opportunities for the
			 				people of the Oweekeno nation.
			 				<br><br>
			 				It was our pleasure to be on this years Egg take along
			 				with Lucky Socks, Star Fish, Logie and the incredible
			 				team of Billie, Sandie, Marshall, Ted, Dwayne, Mandy
			 				and Dave, all living and working together in the Village
			 				and at the Chinook pool.
			 				<br><br>
			 				It was an incredibly moving experience for all of us
			 				and the thought that this year's babies will be the last
			 				that ever need to go on a plane ride made it even more
			 				special. This group of First Nations, DFO and Rec
			 				people working together cant and will not fail.
			 				The future is very bright for all of us.
